In this tutorial, I'll tell you how I understand about Embedded Systems

They could be think of as **computer** systems that is **embedded** into another **larger** system *(Cars, washing machines, friges,â€¦).*. Or in other words, it is the small "chip" that control a larger system.

Some characteristics of embbedded systems are:
- Designed to perform **dedicated** task(s).
- It required tight contrain such as low-cost, low-power, small dimension, fast response.
- Reactive and **real-time**: continuosly reacts to changes in the system's environment and must perform certain actions in real-time without too much delay
